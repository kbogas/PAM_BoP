# PAM_BoP
From Primes to Paths: Enabling Fast Multi-Relational Graph Analysis

Accompanying code (and source of data) for the work on [PAMs](https://github.com/kbogas/PAM) using Bag of Path (BoP) features.

For each task, node classification, relation prediction and graph regression, the corresponding folder contains the scripts needed to reproduce the results presented in the paper.

We use publicly available datasets in our experiments. We zipped together the data for convenience for the node classification and relation prediction tasks, while for the graph regression we utilize commonly-used python modules for data loading.

You can also try out directly the framework by installing the [prime_adj](https://pypi.org/project/prime-adj/) package.

To be updated shortly.
