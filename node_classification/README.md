### Node Classification 

First, make sure to download the datasets as discussed in the datasets README.md

Then, make sure the related requirements are installed, as found in *requirements.txt*, with:

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, you can run **bop_node_classification.py** to run for the BoP + CatBoost model for the node classification task. 
Remember to change the user input values in lines 22-42, according to the dataset/-s you wish to run for.
