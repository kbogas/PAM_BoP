### Relation Prediction 

First, make sure to download the datasets as discussed in the data folder README.md

Then, make sure the related requirements are installed, as found in *requirements.txt*, with:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, you can run **bop_relation_prediction.py** to run for the BoP + kNN for the relation prediction task. 
Remember to change the user input values in lines 22-68, according to the dataset/-s you wish to run for.
The current user selected values are the optimal according to the parameter tuning done.
